### Hi, I'm Rayta 👋🏽,

Yes, there’s one Rayta here, and no, it’s not "Raita" (the famous Indian yogurt, cucumber side dish). Thanks mom and dad. People cannot stop giggling when they read my name now. It's pronounced as "Right-a", but you can also call me "Rei" or "Ray" ✌🏽. My pronouns are she/her 🫡

## What I do
I work as a Senior Engineering Manager for Design Engineering at GitHub. 

## What I love
- 🫣 You might notice I'm a fan of emojis and gifs in my communication 
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 I enjoy hanging out with my family and friends, while enjoying a lovely meal 
- 🌶 I love spicy food 

Pro tip: use this as a excuse when you don't want to share your food ..."It's very spicy!".

Pro tip 2: don't drink water after eating spicy food
