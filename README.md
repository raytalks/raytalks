### Hi, I'm Rayta 👋🏽,

Yes, there’s one Rayta here and no, it’s not Raita (the famous Indian yogurt, cucumber side dish), thanks mom and dad, now people cannot stop giggling when they read my name. 
It's pronouned as "Righta", but you can also call me "Rei" or "Ray" ✌🏽
My pronouns are she/her 🫡

## What I do
I work as a Senior Engineering Manager for Primer Brand and Brand Engineering at GitHub, and I am  deeply embedded in several tech communities like the monthly [Amsterdam Ruby](https://www.amsrb.org/) community, [Lowlands Community Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/lowlands-community/), [DevOpsDays Amsterdam](https://devopsdays.org/events/2022-amsterdam/welcome/), and some more 😎. I love to be part of tech events that support DEI, such as [RailsGirls](http://railsgirls.com/amsterdam2019.html) and [A11y Conf](https://techa11y.dev/) and I'm pretty vocal on these subjects.

I was founder of a [travel agency](https://www.sportiek.com/), but shifted to programming after a couple of years. 
I learned how to write Ruby, became an IC, quickly shifted to a Platform team where I learned about Cloud Computing, became team lead and eventually an Engineering Manager.

In my last profession, I was an EM for a FinTech company where I managed to grow the dev team from 4 to 21 during the pandemic. 

## What I love

- 🐶 I love the walks in the woods with my Bernese Mountaindog 
- 🫣 You might notice I'm a fan of emojis and gifs in my communication 
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 I enjoy hanging out with my family and friends, while enjoying a lovely meal 
- 🌶 I love spicy food 

Pro tip: use this as a excuse when you don't want to share your food ..."It's very spicy!".

Pro tip 2: don't drink water after eating spicy food
